Anton’s Run is a community event held in honor of Anton (Jemali) Davitaia — a dedicated coach who spent over 50 years inspiring young athletes. The route follows the paths where he trained generations of runners, many of whom became professionals. This friendly run celebrates his lasting impact and brings people together through the spirit of sport.
