# About Rural Running

Our running group was founded to explore the beautiful countryside routes around our area. We believe in:

- **Community**: Supporting each other in our running journeys
- **Exploration**: Discovering new paths and scenic routes
- **Wellness**: Promoting healthy, active lifestyles
- **Environment**: Appreciating and preserving our rural landscapes

## Join Us
New runners are always welcome! Contact us through our weekly meetups or check out our route recommendations.
